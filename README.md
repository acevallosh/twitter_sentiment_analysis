Intro to Data Science #2 - Program to Perform Twitter Sentiment Analysis

##Overview
I built a python program to perform sentiment analysis on individual tweets. The code uses the tweepy library to access the Twitter API and the TextBlob library to analyze sentiment based on a pre-determined lexicon. This program allows the user to see how negative or positive each tweet is in whatever topic they choose. I originally wrote this program to understand how public sentiment can affect the price of bitcoins over time.

##Dependencies
- tweepy
- textblob

##Usage
Once you the dependencies are installed installed, run the script in terminal via
`python demo.py`
