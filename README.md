# twitter_sentiment_analysis
Introduction to Data Science

##Overview
I built a python program to perform sentiment analysis on individual tweets. The code uses the tweepy library to access the Twitter API and the TextBlob library to analyze sentiment based on a pre-determined lexicon. This program allows the user to see how negative or positive each tweet is in whatever topic they choose. I originally wrote this program to help me analyze aggregate sentiment re bitcoin and other alcoins on twitter.

##Dependencies
- tweepy
- textblob

##Usage
Once you the dependencies are installed installed, run the script in terminal via
'python demo.py'
